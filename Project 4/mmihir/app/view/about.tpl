    <h2>About</h2>
    <h3>Intro</h3>
    <p>Welcome to the Depp family tree website! Here you can find information about the family as a whole as well each member
        and their relationships to each other.</p>
    <p>To get started, either head over to the family overview or the homepage from the navigation bar above.</p>
    <p>This website proudly made using HTML, CSS, JS, Tea, and Tears!</p>
    <h3>Some Tips</h3>
    <p>This webpage might be slightly unstable, it was after all made quite haphazardly. Careful with it!</p>
    <p>Apart from that, there really isn't much to learn, this is a basic front-end so any edit/add/remove changes won't work.</p>
    <h3>Page Summaries</h3>
    <h4>Home</h4>
    <p>Where you start, pretty self explanatory.</p>
    <h4>My Family</h4>
    <p>The overview of the family. Gives you a quick glance at all the members and some basic information.</p>
    <h4>Add a person</h4>
    <h>A quick way to add a member to the family. Currently only a front end and doesn't work.</h>
    <h4>Profile</h4>
    <p>Eventually, this will link to a 'my profile' page assuming you can login and are a family member</p>
    <h4>About</h4>
    <p>This admittedly rather unhelpful you are on right now.</p>
