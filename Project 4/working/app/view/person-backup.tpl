        <h3>Birth and Early Life</h3>
        <p class="text-justify">Guy was born on a balmy January day in the suburbs of
          Columbus, Ohio. Before he could even speak, he loved airplanes. Everything
          about them fascinated him, and as soon as he could walk on his own,
          his dad bought him a remote control airplane to fly in the backyard.
          When he was 7, he was out flying his plane when he fell down a 5 story
          drop and broke both of his legs. He eventually recovered, but his dreams
          of becoming a pilot were forever shattered, just like his femurs. He
          was temporarily in a wheelchair for the duration of the healing process,
          where he came to realize his love of culinary arts. Trying new dishes and
          watching cooking shows quickly became his favorite pastimes. Before
          long, he had sampled every item on the menu of every restaurant in the area.
          This love of food would shape the rest of his life.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="col-md-6 px-3">
        <h3>Adulthood</h3>
        <p class="text-justify">Guy's love of food carried with him as he grew up.
          Eventually, he had become famous in his town and was discovered by the
          Food Network. They started the soon-to-be world-renowned show "Diners,
          Drive-ins and Dives", which was a smash hit with the network executives
          and viewers all over. As his career progressed, he hosted other shows,
          like cooking-related game shows. He still has yet to visit every single
          restaurant in America, and thus the show continues.</p>

        <h4>18 Aug. 1977</h4>
        <p class="text-justify">When he was younger, Guy had a terrible battle with elbow
          cancer. After a long, grueling fight, it finally went into remission
          and he is now cancer-free.</p>

        <h4>20 Dec. 1998</h4>
        <p class="text-justify">A quite impressive and very important feat to note, Guy
          once had fried mac and cheese that was fried in Cheeto dust instead
          of bread crumbs. It became his favorite dish, and he still loves it to
          this day.</p>

        <h4>1 Feb. 2002</h4>
        <p class="text-justify">Guy Fieri is now a world-renowned pole vaulter. While he
          isn't the best at it, in 2002 he learned how to do it simultaneously
          while throwing shotput. He has competed in the Olympics before on the
          Flavortown team, but has never won a medal.</p>

          mysteriously appear out of nowhere on that fateful day in the mid-90's.
          She quickly wooed Guy, who was standing there with barbecue sauce all
          over his pudgy face and flame button-down shirt. The two got married
          on the spot and never looked back. Since then, they have had two kids
          and lots of ribs.</p>

          He enjoys doing yoga and standing on the beach with his toes in the sand.
          Sometimes, when he's feeling rebellious, he grabs a bottle of Jack Daniels
          from the built-in bar in their living room and drives his dad's Camaro
          under the 32nd Street bridge where he purchases ferrets for fighting
          at the local animal fight club.</p>

          Horses, bicycles, and the roofs of train cars are among his favorites.
          He also likes going to sports games, like extreme rugby and ostrich races.
          Ryder likes playing with Legos, especially by throwing them all over the
          floor so that his parents step on them.</p>
