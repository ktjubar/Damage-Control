    <h3>The Fieri Family</h3><br>
    <p class="text-justify">WELCOME TO FLAVORTOWN! The Fieris are a fun, food-loving
      family that love to take road trips looking for America’s greatest diners,
      drive-ins, and dives. They pack their suitcases into Guy's cherry-red
      vintage Camaro and explore the country having amazing food and fun.</p>

        <h4>Born: 22 Jan. 1968</h4>
        <p class="text-justify">Guy has frosted tips. This is his most defining attribute,
          other than the fact that he loves to shove food into his piehole. He goes
          to restaurants on TV and helps them cook their signature dishes, then
          jam-packs food into his gullet. When not filling his stomach, Guy enjoys
          long walks on the beach with piña coladas and getting caught in the rain.
          He also enjoys spending time with his wife and kids.</p>

        <p class="text-justify">Not much is known about Lori Fieri. She seemed to
          mysteriously appear out of nowhere on that fateful day in the mid-90's.
          She quickly wooed Guy, who was standing there with barbecue sauce all
          over his pudgy face and flame button-down shirt. The two got married
          on the spot and never looked back. Since then, they have had two kids
          and lots of ribs.</p>

        <h4>Born: 7 Aug 1996</h4>
        <p class="text-justify">Hunter, unlike his name suggests, doesn't actually like hunting.
          He enjoys doing yoga and standing on the beach with his toes in the sand.
          Sometimes, when he's feeling rebellious, he grabs a bottle of Jack Daniels
          from the built-in bar in their living room and drives his dad's Camaro
          under the 32nd Street bridge where he purchases ferrets for fighting
          at the local animal fight club.</p>

        <p class="text-justify">Ryder, unlike Hunter and his namesake, does like to ride things.
          Horses, bicycles, and the roofs of train cars are among his favorites.
          He also likes going to sports games, like extreme rugby and ostrich races.
          Ryder likes playing with Legos, especially by throwing them all over the
          floor so that his parents step on them.</p>
